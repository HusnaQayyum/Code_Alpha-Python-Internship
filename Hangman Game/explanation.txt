Imported a module named random, which helps in selecting a random word from the list items.

Created a list named words to store predefined words that can be used in the Hangman game.

Used random.choice(words) to randomly select one word from the list and store it in the variable secret_word.

Created a list named guessed_word that contains underscores (_) equal to the number of letters in the selected word.
This is used to hide the word from the player.

Initialized a variable attempts with the value 6, which represents the maximum number of wrong guesses allowed.

Displayed a welcome message to the user and printed the initial hidden word using underscores.

Used a while loop that runs as long as the number of attempts is greater than zero.

Took a letter input from the user using the input() function.

Checked whether the guessed letter exists in the secret word.

If the guessed letter is present in the word, a for loop is used to check each position of the word and reveal the correct letter in the hidden word.

If the guessed letter is not present in the word, the number of attempts is decreased by one.

Displayed the updated word after each guess along with the remaining attempts.

Checked whether there are any underscores left in the guessed word.
If no underscores remain, the game ends because the user has guessed the word correctly.

After the loop ends, the program checks whether the user has won or lost and displays the final result along with the correct word
